        <h2 class="label col-lg-3">01.<br>About</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h5>I grew up on the beautiful coast of Southern California, just outside of Los Angeles. In 2015, I graduated from Redondo Union High School. I went on to study business part-time at Long Beach Community College while working as a restaurant server.
            I enjoyed learning about finance, communication, and how business visions become a reality. This year, I came to a crossroad.<br><br>
            The pandemic shut down the restaurant I worked at and in June 2020, I graduated with my Associates Degree in Business Administration. I saw this unique period of time as an opportunity to plan out my next move. Among my options, I was considering
            transferring and switching majors to Computer Science.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><em>
            Why Computer Science?</em><br><br>I have always had a curiosity and fascination with programming and the theory behind coding language. I wanted to understand the patterns behind our technology, and to learn to use it for creation and problem solving.
              However, I hadn’t yet explored the subject in detail or taken any formal courses, and I knew I had to at least try it first.<br><br>In
              May 2020, I began learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using online resources. From the first couple of exercises, I was hooked. I loved the blend of logic, creativity, and problem solving and I couldn’t wait to learn more – it was like an entire
              new world had opened up.<br><br>
              The more research I did, the more I realized that a CS degree wasn’t my only option. In fact, it probably wasn’t the wisest, most practical option for me either. But I knew there wasn’t any going back. I was committed to learning this well and knew
              that this is what I wanted to do.<br><br>I
                began an online bootcamp, while supplementing my learning with personal projects/practice and self-study. At one point I thought, “Why didn’t I try this before?!” That said, I am actually very proud of the journey. I believe that my extensive
                experience in customer service, as well as my education in business administration will make me a more well-rounded employee in any position.<br><br>My
                end goal is to become a full-stack developer. I am eager to put the hours and the effort into achieving that goal. I am extremely team oriented and love collaborating with and learning from others. But I’m also unafraid to work independently and take
                a hands-on approach in life. No job is too big or too small. Any opportunity to learn and grow is invaluable to me.<br><br>In
                my free time, I am probably:<br><br> Meeting new people or trying learning something new / Hiking in the mountains or biking at the beach / Exploring new LA restaurants or bars / Traveling or road-tripping / Talking about movies or music / Working on a new
                code project.<br><br>I also commit a significant amount of time to a volunteer education work that I am passionate about. This is a huge staple in my life.</span></h5>
